It’s best to measure your inseam with a pair of shoes on so that you can ensure the hem hits at the right point on your shoe.", additionalInfo: "For women, keep in mind that the accurate inseam measurement depends on whether you’re wearing heels or flats. The hem should hit at the middle of the heel shaft or should hit just slightly above the flat shoe. It would be best for women to take two measurements for inseams — one for trousers you’d wear with heels, and one for trousers you’d wear with flats." }

Ensure that the tape is consistently level and that you’re not wrapping the tape too tightly around your neck. This measurement is your true neck measurement. For your dress shirt neck measurement, add a half inch to a round number (i.e. 14 inches should be rounded up to 14.5 inches) or round up to the nearest half inch (i.e. 14.25 should be rounded up to 14.5)." },

Have a friend measure from the center of your back, across your shoulder, down to your elbow and then to your wrist for your full sleeve measurement. Most sleeve measurements fall between 32 and 39 inches. Sleeve sizes are always in whole numbers; round up to the nearest whole number if needed." },
